\textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Explanation} \\
\hline
\textbf{Simplicity} & Power iteration is mathematically simple and easy to implement using basic matrix–vector operations ($A v$ and $A^T u$). \\
\hline
\textbf{Memory Efficiency} & It doesn’t require storing large intermediate matrices; ideal for image data where the matrix size can be very large. \\
\hline
\textbf{Speed for Top-k SVD} & It focuses only on the largest few singular values (k values), which are enough for compression, instead of computing the full SVD. \\
\hline
\textbf{Numerical Stability} & By normalizing vectors in each iteration, it maintains numerical stability. \\
